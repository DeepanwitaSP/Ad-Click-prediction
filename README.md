#Ad Click Prediction 
The aim of this project is to predict if a client will click on an advertisement based on factors
such as daily time spent on the site, age, area income, daily internet usage, and gender etc.

##Input Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in the 'advertising.csv' file. It contains the following columns:
Ad Topic Line: The headline of the advertisement.
City: The city where the customer lives.
Country: The country where the customer lives.
Timestamp: The timestamp of when the customer clicked on the ad.
Daily Time Spent on Site: The amount of time (in minutes) that the customer spends on the website daily.
Age: The age of the customer.
Area Income: The income of the customer's area.
Daily Internet Usage: The amount of internet usage (in minutes) by the customer daily.
Male: Gender of the customer (1 for male, 0 for female).
Clicked on Ad: The target variable indicating whether the customer clicked on the ad (1) or not (0).

##Libraries used 
NumPy: For mathematical computing
Pandas: For data analysing
Matplotlib: Plotting the graphs
Seaborn: To build statical graphs and visualizing data
scikit-learn: Import essential libraries for model building

##Conclusion
The code will determine the logistic regression model's accuracy score. Furthermore, based on the specified features,
it will forecast whether a hypothetical customer will click on the ad or not.
This project shows how to use machine learning algorithms to predict ad clicks based on customer data.
